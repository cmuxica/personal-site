        <p>
          I am a third-year PhD student at UCLA in the department of linguistics. My interests are in sentence processing, language acquisition, and semantics/pragmatics. I have secondary interests in intonation and computational linguistics. Currently, I am investigating the selection of focus alternatives during real-time comprehension and the role of discourse structure in syntactic bootstrapping. I am advised by <a href="https://jesseharris.netlify.app/">Jesse Harris</a> and <a href="https://laurelperkins.com/">Laurel Perkins</a> on these projects respectively. Other advisors in the department include <a href="https://dylanbumford.com/">Dylan Bumford</a>, <a href="https://www.timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/">Tim Hunter</a>, and <a href="https://sunahjun.humspace.ucla.edu/">Sun-Ah Jun</a>.

          Before coming to Los Angeles, I was a Lab Manager for the <a href="https://xlingumass.github.io/">XLing Laboratories</a> at UMass Amherst where I earned my undergraduate degree. I was advised by <a href="https://people.umass.edu/bwdillon/">Brian Dillon</a> there. I like cyclcing and making music in my free time. <a href="https://www.tapmusic.net/collage.php?user=maaztx&type=7day&size=3x3&caption=true">Here's</a> what I listened to this week.
